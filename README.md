# Accident Detection Model

This application showcases the capabilities of our Accident Detection Model, a pivotal component of our research project focused on Accident Detection within Smart City Transportation frameworks.

## Overview

The application empowers users to view a selection of sample accident videos and upload a new video to test the model. Our model is adept at detecting accidents in both trimmed and untrimmed video formats.
